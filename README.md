## How to run
For the application to work, you have to run the client and the server at the same time. At the root of the project, do the following:
1. To run the server: 
```
	cd server
	npm install
	npm start
```
2. To run the client:
```
	cd client
	npm install
	npm start
```
3. For local development, the full application will be running at http://localhost:3000. The server will be running on http://localhost:3001
